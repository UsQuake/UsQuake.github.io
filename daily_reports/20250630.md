## Review
  
  - Studied usage of GumTreeDiff, which is a amazing tool to get difference information from file.
    
    * Especially, WebDiff is a visually good.
    * TextDiff was look parsable easilly.

  - I analyzed difference between source code(commons-lang, BUG ID:4) of bug-induction timing and each of bug-detection in WebDiff.
